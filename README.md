**Credit Risk Prediction Project**

The risk in credit and lending provided by banks to individuals lies in the potential for default, where the borrower is unable to fully repay their loans. Banks must therefore assess whether individuals have the capacity to reimburse their loans to ensure that these financial investments yield positive outcomes. This is important for ensuring sound financial decision-making.

The goal of this project is to develop a model that assesses whether an individual is likely to fail to repay their debts on time. This credit scoring algorithm will be implemented as a supervised machine learning classification task, using the "Give Me Some Credit" dataset provided by Kaggle (Link)(1).

This dataset provides relevant features such as prior failure to repay loans on time, monthly income, lines of credit, number of dependents and number of current loans. The model will predict the whether an individual will experience a delinquency of 90 days or worse. Among the features, the most indicative of credit default is expected to be previous occurrences of financial stress, demonstrated by repeated failures to repay loans on time.
